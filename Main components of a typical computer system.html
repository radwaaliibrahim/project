<div style="text-align:left">
<p style="font-size:15px;">The processor, the memory, the input / output device and the communication channels that connect it.The processor is the workhorse of the system; it is the component that executes the program by performing arithmetic and logical data operations. It is the only component that generates new information by combining or modifying current information. There will be only one processor, known at the central processing unit, or CPU, in the typical system. Modern high-performance systems, such as vector processors and parallel processors, often have more than one processor. Systems with only one processor are serial processors, or scalar processors, especially among computational scientists.

Memory is a passive component that simply stores information until another part of the system requests it. It feeds instructions and data to the processor during normal operations, and at other times it is the source or destination of the data transferred to I / O devices. The address of the information in the memory is accessed. In programming language terms, memory can be viewed as a one-dimensional M array.

Input / output ( I / O) devices transmit information without altering it between an external world and one or more internal components. I / O devices may be secondary memories, such as disks and tapes, or devices used to communicate directly with users, such as video displays, keyboards, and mouses.
