<p style="font-size:20px;">Von Neumann Architecture:</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">This architecture is being proposed by John von-neumann. Now the computer of the day we use is based on the von-neumann architecture. It's based on a few concepts.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Architecture of Harvard:</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">The Harvard architecture is used when data and code are present in different memory blocks.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Architecture Instruction Set:</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">Instruction set architecture is needed to make up the architecture, because it has a set of instructions that the processor understands. It has two instruction set, one is RISC (reduced instruction set computer) and the other is CISC (complex instruction set computer).</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Micro-architecture:</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">Microarchitecture is known as a computer organization and is the way a built-in processor is used to set an instruction architecture.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Design of the system:</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">The name defines itself, the design satisfies user requirements, such as architecture, module, interfaces and system data, and is linked to product development. It is the process of obtaining marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. Modular systems are made by standardization of hardware and software.</p>
